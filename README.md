# TelMap
TelMap is a script for viewing people nearby by coordinates in Telegram.

Important! There is always a chance that your account will be blocked! To use the script, you need a telegram API account that has a profile picture, and it must also be visible to other users. Otherwise, your account will be blocked and the script will not work.

You can use multiple coordinates to scan a large size, for this you need to create a text file with the coordinates written in a column.
