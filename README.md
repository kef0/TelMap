# TelMap
TelMap is a script for viewing people nearby by coordinates in Telegram.

Important! There is always a chance that your account will be blocked! To use the script, you need a telegram API account that has a profile picture, and it must also be visible to other users. Otherwise, your account will be blocked and the script will not work.
You need to write your API in a file API.txt before you start working, you can get it here https://my.telegram.org/

You can use multiple coordinates to scan a large size, for this you need to create a text file with the coordinates written in a column.

At the end of the scan, the script will create a text file with the information.
